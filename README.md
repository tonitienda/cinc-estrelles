Playground to work on microservices with different technologies I want to try out, learn or keep using.

## Intro

I would not recoment a 1-team (or 1-person) project to deal with lots of different technologies or
to move to microservices prematurely. 

But in this project I want to learn some technologies, so this project will follow the anti-pattern
CV-driven development. 

I will start with a conservative microservice architecture. There are a couple of services I know their boundaries
and I will make them separated, but I will keep the core of the application as a monolith to ease the changes in requirements.

Once the shape and the boundaries are more clear I will try to take out some functionalities to their own services
and try to deal with the challenges there.

I will keep an ADR with the decisions made on each stage of the development.
