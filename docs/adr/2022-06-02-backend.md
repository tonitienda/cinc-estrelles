# Backend technologies

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to define the tecnology to run the backend.
It should be a performant and data driven language. And also interesting to learn.

## Considered Options

- NodeJs-Typescript
- Golang
- Clojure

## Decision Outcome

- NodeJS-Typescript would be the most productive language, but this project is not about productivity but for learning.
- Golang looks like an interesting language to learn and very fast. The syntax is C-Like so it should not be very difficult to learn.
- Clojure seems slower than Golang and the syntax is based on LISP, so it will be the most difficult to learn. The way it manages data (hashmaps), the validation part with spec  and the datastructures used in the language seem like a different paradigm altogether.
  
The decision will be to start working with Clojure for the backend that will be monolithic in principle. 
If at some point another service or some development on Kubernetes Controllers or similar are needed, Golang will be considered.
