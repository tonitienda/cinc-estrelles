# Front end for Market Place

## Context and Problem Statement

The hotel will need a front end where potential customers can see information about the hotel
and make some managements like do reservations, see availability, events, etc.

The requirements are still not clear, and therefore we will need to update the front end (and the APIs behind it) periodically.
A lot of contents will be mainly static or not very frequently updated.

## Considered Options

- Angular
- Vanilla React
- NextJS - React

## Decision Outcome

The decision is NextJS-React.
The main reason is that I am more confortable with react and I know how to use Material UI
to help in the layout of the application and NextJs offers some nice features to pre-render
the static pages and improve the performance.

We will start with a small default application and we will work on the features later on.
