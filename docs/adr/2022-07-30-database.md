# Databsae

## Context and Problem Statement

The application will need storage to save the data managed in it.

## Analysis

There are multiple databases: Relational, Graph, Document, etc.

Postgresql is a well known and versatile DB with good support for destructured
data in JSON or JSONB format.

Data migrations should be part of the release process, so we will need a way to script
these migrations and allow to rollback if needed (although the need rollback should be avoided )

The format of the stored data will be decided in a different document.

## Proposed solution

Use PostgreSQL as DB
Use flyway for migrations

## Status

Decided
