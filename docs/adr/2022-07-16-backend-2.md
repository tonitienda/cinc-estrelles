# Backend technologies

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to define the tecnology to run the backend.

## Considered Options

- NodeJs-Typescript
- Golang
- Clojure

## Decision Outcome

I changed my mind. I will be working in Typescript shaping the project and I will work on
another project-playground with clojure.
I can focus in the functional aspect of the project here and when a new service is needed or
part of the monilith can be extracted to a different service, I will consider Clojure and Golang
again.

## Status
